/* Welcome to the SQL mini project. You will carry out this project partly in
the PHPMyAdmin interface, and partly in Jupyter via a Python connection.

This is Tier 2 of the case study, which means that there'll be less guidance for you about how to setup
your local SQLite connection in PART 2 of the case study. This will make the case study more challenging for you: 
you might need to do some digging, aand revise the Working with Relational Databases in Python chapter in the previous resource.

Otherwise, the questions in the case study are exactly the same as with Tier 1. 

PART 1: PHPMyAdmin
You will complete questions 1-9 below in the PHPMyAdmin interface. 
Log in by pasting the following URL into your browser, and
using the following Username and Password:

The data you need is in the "country_club" database. This database
contains 3 tables:
    i) the "Bookings" table,
    ii) the "Facilities" table, and
    iii) the "Members" table.

In this case study, you'll be asked a series of questions. You can
solve them using the platform, but for the final deliverable,
paste the code for each solution into this script, and upload it
to your GitHub.

Before starting with the questions, feel free to take your time,
exploring the data, and getting acquainted with the 3 tables. */


/* QUESTIONS 
/* Q1: Some of the facilities charge a fee to members, but some do not.
Write a SQL query to produce a list of the names of the facilities that do. */

SELECT *
FROM `Facilities`
WHERE NOT membercost =0
LIMIT 0 , 30

/* Q2: How many facilities do not charge a fee to members? */

SELECT count(distinct name) FROM `Facilities` where membercost=0;
4 facilities do not charge a fee to members

/* Q3: Write an SQL query to show a list of facilities that charge a fee to members,
where the fee is less than 20% of the facility's monthly maintenance cost.
Return the facid, facility name, member cost, and monthly maintenance of the
facilities in question. */

SELECT `facid`,`name`,`membercost`,`monthlymaintenance` FROM `Facilities` where membercost/`monthlymaintenance` <0.2


/* Q4: Write an SQL query to retrieve the details of facilities with ID 1 and 5.
Try writing the query without using the OR operator. */
SELECT *
FROM Facilities
order by facid
limit 0,6

/* Q5: Produce a list of facilities, with each labelled as
'cheap' or 'expensive', depending on if their monthly maintenance cost is
more than $100. Return the name and monthly maintenance of the facilities
in question. */

SELECT name,monthlymaintenance,
case when monthlymaintenance >100 then 'expensive'
else 'cheap' end as label
FROM Facilities

/* Q6: You'd like to get the first and last name of the last member(s)
who signed up. Try not to use the LIMIT clause for your solution. */
SELECT surname, firstname,joindate FROM `Members` 
where joindate =(select max(joindate) from `Members` )


/* Q7: Produce a list of all members who have used a tennis court.
Include in your output the name of the court, and the name of the member
formatted as a single column. Ensure no duplicate data, and order by
the member name. */

SELECT distinct concat(firstname,' ', surname) as name FROM `Members` ORDER BY name


/* Q8: Produce a list of bookings on the day of 2012-09-14 which
will cost the member (or guest) more than $30. Remember that guests have
different costs to members (the listed costs are per half-hour 'slot'), and
the guest user's ID is always 0. Include in your output the name of the
facility, the name of the member formatted as a single column, and the cost.
Order by descending cost, and do not use any subqueries. */

SELECT name as f_name,concat(surname,' ',firstname) as name, starttime,
case when b.memid=0 then slots*guestcost
else slots*membercost end as cost
from Bookings b inner join Facilities f on f.facid =b.facid
inner join Members m on b.memid=m.memid
where starttime>='2012-09-14' and starttime <'2012-09-15' 
order by cost desc



/* Q9: This time, produce the same result as in Q8, but using a subquery. */

SELECT facility_name,name as name,cost
from (select name as facility_name,concat(surname,' ',firstname) as name, 
case when b.memid=0 then slots*guestcost
else slots*membercost end as cost
